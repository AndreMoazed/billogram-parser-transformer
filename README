In order to pass a previously seen countries list a text file with the list of
countries should be present in the root of the project (an empty file is currently provided)
This file is populated with the new countries that are detected when running the program.

Missing features:
Currently there is no real data validation implemented, th program simply fails if the incorrect xml type is passed
Logging would be added, currently only printing to the console
